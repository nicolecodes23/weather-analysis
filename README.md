# weather-analysis (terminal based)
Weather analysis and prediction in C++. A terminal-based C++ application to parse, filter, and analyze large sets of historical weather data from CSV files. It provides powerful data processing capabilities and visualizes daily temperature fluctuations using custom-rendered candlestick plots directly in the terminal.

## Features

- **CSV Parsing & Filtering**: Efficiently reads large CSV files containing historical weather data. Supports filtering based on date ranges, temperature thresholds, and other parameters.
- **Data Analysis**: Calculates key weather statistics such as average temperature, highs, lows, and variability.
- **Candlestick Visualization**: Renders daily temperature fluctuations as candlestick plots in the terminal for intuitive visual analysis.
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Runs completely in the terminal without external dependencies or graphical libraries.

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++) supporting C++11 or later
- Terminal or command-line interface

# Data Overview

The full CSV file (~75MB) is **not included** in this repository due to size constraints.

To run the project, replace the downloaded CSV file in the project root directory with the filename `weather_data_EU_1980-2019_temp_only.csv`.

If you need the data or have any questions, feel free to contact me.
